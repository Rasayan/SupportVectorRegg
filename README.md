# Support Vector Regression Model(SVR)

This is a SVR model done on Python. The libraries used in this .py file are :-

NUMPY, PANDAS, MATPLOTLIB, SCIKIT LEARN

The datasheet file (Python_Salaries.csv), which is gathered from an online source, has been supplied.

There are two results in this svr.py code

1) SVR result with low precision
2) SVR result with high precision

Non predicted values are represented by a RED dot
Predicted Values are given in a BLUE line

#### Hppy Coding :)
